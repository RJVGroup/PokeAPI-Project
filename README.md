# Roguelike game using PokeAPI

We were tasked to build an application using the PokeAPI. We decided to create a Roguelite game using the information provided by the API. Our basic rest services are controlled by a springboot application and the game is controlled on the front end using a React application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Installing the pokemon-app folder
